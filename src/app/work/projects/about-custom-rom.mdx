## Overview

This project centers on the development of a custom Android ROM tailored for enhanced system performance and long-term stability. The focus is to deliver a reliable and responsive user experience, particularly for budget and mid-range devices, by optimizing the system at every layer.

## Key Features

- **Performance-Oriented System Tweaks** : Integrated low-latency kernel configurations, reduced background service overhead, and tuned schedulers for optimal resource management.
- **Lightweight UI Optimizations** : Customized Android UI for minimal lag, smoother animations, and faster transitions without sacrificing functionality.
- **Stability and Reliability** : Extensive testing and debugging to ensure daily usability, crash-free operation, and consistent behavior across updates.
- **Build Automation (CI/CD)** : Developed a fully automated Using Servers or Local to compile builds, monitor errors, and streamline OTA distribution.
- **Device Bring-up & Maintenance** : Created and maintained device trees from scratch, managing proprietary blobs, init scripts, and hardware abstraction layers for various chipsets.

## Technologies Used

- **Shell Scripting**: To operate the build automatically and send error logs if an error occurs.
- **Telegram Bot API **: Make Telegram Bot As Intermediary For Interaction From Server.
- **Linux**: For As an Operating System used for development.
- **ADB**: Used for flashing, testing, and bug investigation processes in the system using logcat and etc.
- **Github**: For source management, collaboration, and version control of ROM sources and device trees.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenges were fixing bugs and adjusting the device tree to ensure proper hardware support and system stability. This process involved a lot of testing, log analysis, and learning how Android interacts with specific hardware components.

## Outcome

The final build delivered a user-friendly and responsive Android experience, with a focus on long-term stability and reliability. System optimizations ensured smooth daily usage, even on lower-end hardware. Regular updates and maintenance were provided to keep the system secure, compatible, and efficient over time making it suitable for long-term use.
